## 1. Overview

This document provides a high-level roadmap for progressively merging Gibsey’s existing technology stacks (QDPI, QEE, PCHL, MNR, etc.) into a convergent neural–symbolic system on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 

---

## 2. Subsystem Mapping

Below are representative mappings between Gibsey’s current subsystems and known AI architectures. These parallels help us determine how each subsystem can plug into a hybrid neural–symbolic “core.”

1. **QDPI (Quantum Data Processing & Ingestion)**  
   - **Analogue**: Data ingestion layer (akin to large-scale ETL in neural pipelines).  
   - **Role**: Aggregates and preprocesses diverse data streams, possibly with quantum-based or high-throughput transformations.  
   - **Potential Convergence**: Feeds data directly into neural encoders or symbolic processing graphs.

2. **QEE (Quantum Execution Environment)**  
   - **Analogue**: Specialized hardware accelerator (GPUs, TPUs, or quantum co-processors) for model training and inference.  
   - **Role**: Executes massively parallel computations. May incorporate advanced sampling or quantum-based attention mechanisms.  
   - **Potential Convergence**: Acts as the “compute substrate” for complex models (transformers, differentiable knowledge graphs, etc.).

3. **PCHL (Predictive Cognitive Heuristics Layer)**  
   - **Analogue**: Symbolic reasoner or rule-based system that refines or constrains neural outputs.  
   - **Role**: Encodes domain heuristics, motifs, or logical constraints. Potentially acts as a memory-based attention or gating module.  
   - **Potential Convergence**: Connects to the hidden state of neural models to guide inference via symbolic patterns.

4. **MNR (Multi-Narrative Reasoning)**  
   - **Analogue**: Multi-modal / multi-task transformer or knowledge graph reasoner.  
   - **Role**: Integrates scenario-based or narrative-based reasoning with flexible chain-of-thought prompting.  
   - **Potential Convergence**: Provides top-level narrative context that shapes neural attention and symbolic decision trees.

---

## 3. Convergence Layers

Convergence layers enable cross-talk between neural and symbolic representations, data gradients, and knowledge graphs:

1. **Neural–Symbolic Bridge**  
   - A “memory-augmented transformer” layer that reads from/writes to symbolic structures.  
   - Accepts gradient signals (for neural parts) and symbolic constraints (for the rule-based parts).  
   - Example: A differentiable knowledge graph engine that handles textual input and returns structured inferences as key–value memory.

2. **Data Exchange Layer**  
   - Aggregates data from QDPI and surfaces it to QEE.  
   - Manages raw embeddings, token streams, and environment states.  
   - Example: A multi-modal encoder layer capable of merging textual, numerical, and sensor data, possibly in a quantum-optimized manner.

3. **Symbolic Tensor Channel**  
   - A specialized pipeline for PCHL rules or motifs, ensuring they can be injected as attention bias or gating signals in MNR.  
   - Example: Weighted adjacency/tensor that influences transformer self-attention patterns.

## 4. Three-Phase Build-Out

### Phase 1: **Foundation**
- **Focus**: Establish robust data flows, modularize existing subsystems.  
- **Key Activities**:
  - Integrate QDPI → QEE pipeline for high-throughput data ingestion/training.
  - Define symbolic format for PCHL heuristics (e.g., in differentiable form).
  - Build scaffolding for MNR to handle multi-narrative reasoning tasks.
- **Target Metrics**:
  - **Parameters**: ~1B–10B  
  - **FLOPs**: 10^12–10^13 FLOPs per training run  
  - **Token Throughput**: 1M tokens/day  
  - **Symbolic Ops/sec**: 10^6

### Phase 2: **Integration**
- **Focus**: Fuse neural and symbolic layers with feedback loops (gradient + rule-based).  
- **Key Activities**:
  - Implement the Neural–Symbolic Bridge with memory-augmented transformers.
  - Add motif-guided attention from PCHL → MNR.
  - Validate differentiable constraints (CSL: Context-Sensitive Logic) in real tasks.
  - Begin limited nutrient-diffusion backprop (i.e., cross-layer gradient signals that incorporate symbolic gating).
- **Target Metrics**:
  - **Parameters**: ~10B–100B  
  - **FLOPs**: 10^14–10^15 FLOPs per training run  
  - **Token Throughput**: 10M tokens/day  
  - **Symbolic Ops/sec**: 10^7–10^8

### Phase 3: **Emergence**
- **Focus**: Self-optimizing neural–symbolic architecture with dynamic reasoning.  
- **Key Activities**:
  - Scale MNR to real-time, multi-modal (text, audio, visual) data streams.
  - Expand memory embeddings to handle knowledge spanning multiple domains.
  - Finalize cross-layer introspection: the system fine-tunes its own symbolic heuristics.
  - Demonstrate emergent behaviors, including creative problem-solving and multi-step planning.  
- **Target Metrics**:
  - **Parameters**: 100B–1T+  
  - **FLOPs**: 10^16–10^18 FLOPs per training run  
  - **Token Throughput**: 100M tokens/day  
  - **Symbolic Ops/sec**: 10^9+

## 5. Required Research Spikes

1. **Differentiable CSL (Context-Sensitive Logic)**  
   - Investigate frameworks for capturing domain-specific logic in forms that are trainable end-to-end.  
   - Key output: Integration of rule-based systems into backprop pipelines without collapsing.

2. **Motif-Guided Attention**  
   - Discover or define domain-specific motifs that can bias attention at runtime.  
   - Key output: Improved interpretability and better alignment with symbolic rules.

3. **Nutrient Diffusion Backprop**  
   - Explore new gradient distribution mechanisms that “feed” certain symbolic pathways while pruning others.  
   - Key output: More efficient training and dynamic model architecture adaptation.

```
- **QDPI** feeds data to the execution environment (QEE).  
- **QEE** provides computational resources for training/inference.  
- **PCHL** injects symbolic heuristics into a “Neural–Symbolic Bridge.”  
- The “Neural–Symbolic Bridge” merges data embeddings with symbolic constraints.  
- **MNR** builds scenarios or narratives across domains, orchestrating the final reasoning.

## 9. Activation Criteria (Proto-AGI)

To responsibly designate Gibsey as “proto-AGI,” the following checkpoints or signals should be met:

1. **Contextual Reasoning**  
   - System can fluidly switch contexts between multiple domains without extensive hand-engineering.
2. **Emergent Problem-Solving**  
   - Demonstrated ability to chain symbolic and neural reasoning for novel tasks or scenarios.
3. **Adaptive Self-Optimization**  
   - System autonomously adjusts its architecture, either by resource re-allocation, dynamic gating, or symbolic rule revision.
4. **Theory of (Model) Mind**  
   - Basic internal introspection: the system can detect and correct internal inconsistencies.
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  
   - Proven orchestration or collaboration with external agents or system modules, showing near-human-level synergy.

Once these criteria are consistently met under real-world testing conditions, Gibsey can be formally considered a proto-AGI system.
