Got it. I’ll scan all `.md` files in the `/docs/backlog/` folder of the `mbu09a/Gibsey` repo to identify named systems (e.g. Layers, Protocols, Engines, etc.) that are mentioned but don’t have a corresponding spec file. I’ll then quote their usage, infer their purpose, estimate MVP impact, and suggest canonical filenames. The final deliverables will include a `spec_gap_report.md` listing the top 10 highest-impact gaps, and a “Next-Up” checklist to guide spec drafting.

I’ll update you as soon as the report is ready.


# Spec Gap Report – Missing System Specifications

Below are the **top 10 missing technical spec documents** identified, ranked by their impact on the MVP (High > Medium > Low) and how frequently they appear in the backlog. Each entry includes a defining quote from the backlog, an inferred purpose of the system, an impact assessment, and a suggested spec filename.

1. **Quad-Directional Protocol Interface (QDPI-256)** — *Impact: High*

   > “Below is an opinionated, end‑to‑end MVP blueprint—aligned with Gibsey’s bi‑directional gift logic and the **Quad‑Directional Protocol Interface (QDPI)**—that allows users to Read → Ask → Receive → Save a “shard” in under 2 seconds at scale.”
   > *Purpose:* A foundational interaction **interface** enabling the system’s four-phase loop (Read ↔ Ask ↔ Receive ↔ Save) between users and AIs, essentially coordinating how information flows in all directions.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `quad-directional-protocol-interface-spec.md`

2. **Pro O1 bus** — *Impact: High*

   > **pro o1** – The amplification **bus** that weights, prioritizes, and routes quad‑directional messages across the QDPI‑256 mesh
   > *Purpose:* A central **message bus** responsible for amplifying and routing events through the system (the QDPI network), ensuring high-priority and efficient communication across all components.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `pro-o1-bus-spec.md`

3. **Quantum‑Entangle Engine (QEE)** — *Impact: Medium*

   > “Below is a conceptual design for the **Quantum‑Entangle Engine (QEE)**—an experimental storytelling system that pairs user decisions with Schrödinger‑style narrative branches and “collapses” them only upon a final choice or observation.”
   > *Purpose:* An **orchestration engine** that runs multiple AI-driven narrative threads in parallel (in a “quantum” superposition) and only resolves story outcomes once the user makes a definitive choice, allowing dynamic, multi-path storytelling.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `quantum-entangle-engine-spec.md`

4. **Convergent Cryptographic Memory Layer (CCML)** — *Impact: Medium*

   > “...how a user’s shard is transferred from the **CCML** (Convergent Cryptographic Memory Layer) to the Oneiric Lattice Confluence... The protocol ensures version integrity, validates provenance, and provides hooks for rolling back if issues arise.”
   > *Purpose:* A **secure memory/data layer** that stores narrative state (“shards”) with cryptographic integrity and convergence properties – enabling consistent versioning, provenance tracking, and safe synchronization of user data (e.g. Vault content) across systems.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `convergent-cryptographic-memory-layer-spec.md`

5. **Polyphonic Corpus Harmonic Loom (PCHL)** — *Impact: Low*

   > “Below is an architected plan for the **Polyphonic Corpus Harmonic Loom (PCHL)**—a generative, multi‑user music engine that translates QDPI events (Read, Ask, Receive, Save) and user states into a living, collaborative symphony.”
   > *Purpose:* A **narrative rendering pipeline** (particularly audio/interactive) that braids together multiple input streams (user actions, “Corpus of 16” symbol states, etc.) into one harmonious output – for example, turning concurrent story events into a collaborative musical or multi-sensory experience.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `polyphonic-corpus-harmonic-loom-spec.md`

6. **Gifted AI Protocol (GAP)** — *Impact: Low*

   > “The **Gifted AI Protocol (GAP)** is designed as an incentive layer enabling reciprocal giving and receiving across eight exchange dimensions (human↔human, AI↔AI, human↔AI, and more).”
   > *Purpose:* An **incentive protocol** for the ecosystem’s economy, introducing a dual-token system (e.g. Magical Bonds and TNA tokens) to encourage reciprocal contributions and balanced value exchange between humans and AIs (a “gift economy” with accountability).
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `gifted-ai-protocol-spec.md`

7. **Identity Kaleidoscope Engine (IKE)** — *Impact: Low*

   > “Below is a design specification for the **Identity Kaleidoscope Engine (IKE)**—a system enabling user avatars to “split” into multiple facet‑shards and “recombine” according to emotional resonance.”
   > *Purpose:* An **adaptive persona system** that allows a user’s identity/avatar to branch into multiple “facets” (each representing different aspects or moods of the user) and later merge them back. This enables rich role-playing and self-exploration by dynamically blending character traits or AI personas.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `identity-kaleidoscope-engine-spec.md`

8. **Counter-Factual Memory Forge (CFMF)** — *Impact: Low*

   > “Below is a design specification for the **Counter‑Factual Memory Forge (CFMF)**—a subsystem that records the paths users *didn’t* take and integrates these “lost possibilities” into a communal mythos.”
   > *Purpose:* A **“what-if” simulation module** that captures narrative paths and user decisions that were not taken (the counterfactual storylines) and preserves them. It can later resurface these alternate outcomes to enrich the overall story world or stress-test plot branches without affecting the main timeline.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `counter-factual-memory-forge-spec.md`

9. **“Quantum Orchestration Layer” (QOL)** — *Impact: Low*

   > *Integration:* CCN provides a higher-level **“Quantum Orchestration Layer (QOL)”** that automatically routes QEE events to relevant sub-systems based on user profiles.
   > *Purpose:* A **coordination layer** in the architecture that sits above individual subsystems. It orchestrates and routes events from systems like QEE and PCHL across the whole platform, ensuring that all components (story engines, sensors, UIs, etc.) act in synchrony according to a user’s holistic profile/state.
   > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `quantum-orchestration-layer-spec.md`

10. **Quantum Dream Phase Index (QDPI)** — *Impact: Low*

    > **QDPI** (Quantum Dream Phase Index) tracks user states across dreamlike or real experiences.
    > *Purpose:* A **256-dimensional state index** for users, mapping each user’s current narrative or experiential context into a “dream quadrant.” This index is used to tag and synchronize the user’s state across different realms (physical, AR/VR, dream simulations), aligning the storytelling experience across modalities.
    > *Suggested Spec Filename:* `quantum-dream-phase-index-spec.md`
