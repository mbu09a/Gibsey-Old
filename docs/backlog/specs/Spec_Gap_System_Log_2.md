3. Open Questions
Q: What is the expected throughput for QDPI-256 encoding/decoding? Should it be optimized for batch operations?
Q: Are there specific accessibility requirements for the QDPI-256 glyphs in the UI?
Q: How should the system handle invalid or corrupted QDPI-256 input?
Q: What are the performance requirements for the shard management service in terms of concurrent users?
Q: Is there a specific error correction strategy for QDPI-256, or is it purely detection?
