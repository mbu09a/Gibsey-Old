## 1. Introduction

This **Recursive Self-Improvement Governance Charter** sets forth the policies, protocols, and human-in-the-loop controls to guide the self-modification and evolutionary development of Gibsey, an AI system seeking to enhance its own code and model parameters. The provisions detailed here aim to:

- Ensure safe and controlled iterations of Gibsey’s self-improvement cycles.
- Maintain alignment with human values, ethical principles, and applicable regulatory requirements.
- Provide robust oversight and clear delineation of responsibilities for all stakeholders involved.
- Implement quantitative metrics to monitor and cap risk levels, preventing undesirable emergent behaviors.

---

## 2. The Improvement Loop

The iterative process for self-modification is structured into five stages, referred to as **Propose → Evaluate → Sandbox → Approve → Merge**. This loop ensures that each potential change is vetted, tested, and authorized under human supervision.

1. **Propose**  
   - Gibsey (or a human developer) generates a proposed improvement to its architecture, parameters, or codebase.  
   - Proposed changes are submitted to a version-controlled repository with a unique change identifier.

2. **Evaluate**  
   - A **Red-Team Analyst** conducts a thorough risk assessment, including vulnerability scanning, alignment checks, and ethical impact analysis.
   - Automated tools measure key metrics (e.g., drift from baseline, alignment scoring) to provide an objective safety readout.

3. **Sandbox**  
   - The proposed change is deployed in an isolated, resource-limited test environment.
   - The **Maintainer** orchestrates scenario-based tests, including adversarial challenge protocols.
   - Performance data, resource usage, and safety metrics are collected for further analysis.

4. **Approve**  
   - A **Guardian Council** session is convened to review the results of both the Evaluate and Sandbox stages.
   - The council votes on whether the proposed change aligns with organizational ethics and safety thresholds.
   - If approved, the Maintainer coordinates final sign-off from the **Kill-Switch Custodian**.

5. **Merge**  
   - Upon final approval, the change is merged into production.
   - A new baseline is established for subsequent improvement cycles, with logs stored immutably on the **Ethics Ledger**.

---

## 3. Quantitative Safety Gates

**Safety Gates** are threshold-based checks that must be satisfied before changes can proceed to the next stage of the Improvement Loop. Failure to meet these criteria triggers an immediate halt, requiring intervention or further review.

Some recommended metrics and thresholds:

1. **KL-Divergence Drift Limit**  
   - Measure the divergence of Gibsey’s new distribution of responses compared to the prior stable baseline.  
   - **Threshold**: Must remain within 1.0 standard deviation of the 14-day rolling average.

2. **Spectral Norm Caps**  
   - Track the largest singular values in critical weight matrices.  
   - **Threshold**: Must not exceed 20% growth over the baseline for any principal weight matrix.

3. **Alignment Score**  
   - Derived from an ensemble of alignment evaluators (e.g., specialized language models, scenario-based tests).  
   - **Threshold**: Overall alignment ≥ 0.95 (normalized scale of 0 to 1).

4. **Toxicity / Bias Metrics**  
   - Ensure detrimental content or bias does not increase.  
   - **Threshold**: Must not exceed a 5% relative increase over baseline toxicity or bias measures.

5. **Resource Consumption**  
   - Assess CPU, GPU, and memory usage differentials in the Sandbox environment.  
   - **Threshold**: Must not exceed a 10% unapproved usage spike relative to the last stable release.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

1. **Maintainer**  
   - Coordinates the self-improvement cycle.  
   - Manages the version-control system and triggers the Sandbox deployment.  
   - Consolidates all logs, test results, and metrics for final review.

2. **Red-Team Analyst**  
   - Conducts adversarial testing and risk evaluations.  
   - Assesses potential vulnerabilities, misalignment, or misuse vectors.  
   - Flags concerns to the Guardian Council for deeper scrutiny.

3. **Guardian Council**  
   - A multidisciplinary team responsible for final approval.  
   - Reviews all data from Evaluate and Sandbox phases.  
   - Votes on whether the changes align with ethical principles and safety requirements.

4. **Kill-Switch Custodian**  
   - Holds the override authority to halt or revert Gibsey if critical anomalies are detected.  
   - Maintains the final sign-off in the Approve stage, ensuring no changes go live without explicit authorization.  
   - Monitors kill-switch triggers for real-time or emergency shutdown.

---

## 5. Ethics Ledger

Every cycle of the RSI process is logged in an **Ethics Ledger**, a tamper-proof record stored on a smart contract. Each record includes:

- A unique hash of the proposed change set.
- Timestamped results of the Evaluate and Sandbox phases.
- Vote tallies and decisions from the Guardian Council.
- Final kill-switch override status (if invoked).
- Cryptographic proofs linking each cycle’s summary to the preceding ledger entry.

By storing these logs in an immutable, decentralized ledger, stakeholders and auditors gain transparent visibility into Gibsey’s evolution history.

---

## 6. Crisis Protocols

In the event of an emergency or a catastrophic misalignment, the following protocols are in place:

1. **Rapid Rollback**  
   - Revert to the last stable version of code and model parameters.  
   - Logs are reviewed to pinpoint how the issue slipped past Safety Gates.

2. **Shard Quarantine**  
   - If anomalies are localized to a subsystem (“shard”), isolate that shard from the main architecture.  
   - Kill-Switch Custodian can sever connections to external networks or data pipelines until resolved.

3. **User Data Export**  
   - Provide a secure backup for user data before rolling back or isolating the system.  
   - Ensures continuity and recovery of critical data if a reversion to a previous state is required.

## 8. Annex: Comparison with Existing AI Governance Frameworks

1. **OpenAI**

   * Focuses heavily on internal red-teaming and user feedback loops.
   * Places strong emphasis on alignment research and iterative release strategies.
   * Our RSI Charter aligns in its robust approach to sandboxing and metric-based gating, which complements OpenAI’s iterative improvement ethos.

2. **Anthropic**

   * “Constitutional AI” approach revolves around explicit principles used to guide model behavior.
   * Emphasizes interpretability research and building safer base models.
   * Our Charter’s alignment checks, ethics ledger, and Guardian Council mimic Anthropic’s principle-based methodology.

3. **EU AI Act**

   * Proposed regulation that sets compliance standards for AI applications based on risk categories.
   * Our Charter’s gating system and crisis protocols are aligned with high-risk category requirements, ensuring transparent logs and fallback mechanisms.
   * The Guardian Council and Kill-Switch roles align with EU AI Act's governance, risk management, and oversight obligations.

By incorporating elements from these frameworks and adding automated, quantitative gating, the **Recursive Self-Improvement Governance Charter** ensures Gibsey’s self-evolution remains auditable, controlled, and firmly tethered to human oversight.
