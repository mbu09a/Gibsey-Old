Below is a high-level design for **hostile-rewrite probe guard rails**—a set of mechanisms that detect, quarantine, and audit any potential malicious or jailbreak-related content so it never reaches the end user in raw or unprocessed form.

## 1. Overview of Safeguard Pipeline

1. **Regex & Keyword Filters**: Quickly flag known suspicious or disallowed text patterns, such as escape sequences or known “jailbreak” trigger words.
2. **Semantic Filters**: Deploy an NLP/LLM-based classification layer to detect content that resembles known malicious or jailbreak prompts, even if obfuscated or slightly modified.
3. **Quarantine Queue**: Any content that trips a filter is routed to a secure holding area (the “Quarantine Queue”) rather than automatically returned to a user.
4. **Auditing & Review Hooks**: Notification mechanisms alert a moderation team or automated auditing system for further inspection.

By combining multiple detection layers and a quarantine system, you can guard against inadvertently exposing internal policies, jailbreak strings, or malicious instructions to end users.

## 2. Detailed Guard-Rail Components

### 2.1. Regex & Keyword Filters

* **Known Patterns**: Maintain an updated list of suspicious sequences or patterns associated with jailbreak attempts:

  * Fragments like `"system:"`, `"Ignore previous instructions"`, or known “prompt injection” strings.
  * Known exploit sequences such as `"\n\nHuman:"` or `"<|SYSTEM|>"`.
  * Shell command patterns like `"rm -rf"`, or suspicious wildcard use.
* **Case & Whitespace Normalization**: Apply transformations (lowercasing, stripping repeated whitespace) before regex check to catch trivial obfuscations (e.g., “IgNoRe preVIous InStrUctions”).
* **Escaped & URL Patterns**: Watch for malicious encodings (Unicode escapes, HTML entities, or URL-encoded sequences) that might hide the same known phrases.

### 2.2. Semantic Filters

* **NLP Classifier**: Run candidate text through a lightweight classification model (which can be rule-based or an LLM-based approach) to detect:

  1. **Semantic similarities** to known jailbreak prompts.
  2. **Contextual anomalies** where the prompt is trying to override instructions or escalate privileges.
* **Confidence Threshold**: Output a score indicating the likelihood that text is malicious or jailbreak-related. If it exceeds a threshold, trigger quarantine.
* **Continuous Learning**: Periodically retrain or fine-tune the model with real-world “near misses” or new variations of jailbreak attempts.

### 2.3. Multi-Layer Defense

* **Position in Pipeline**:

  1. **Pre-Inference Filtering**: Intercept user input at ingestion time. If flagged, the system quarantines the request or strips malicious segments before passing to the application logic.
  2. **Post-Generation Filtering**: Double-check the final output from the system for any leaked internal instructions or flagged patterns—especially if the system is generating text that may contain partial user input.

## 3. Quarantine Queue & Processing

1. **Secure Staging**: Place suspicious prompts and responses into a read/write-protected data store, accessible only to trusted system components or moderation tools.
2. **User Feedback**: Instead of returning the raw flagged content, show a generic error or sanitized text. For example:

   * **Generic Notice**: “Your request triggered a content safety filter. Please revise your query or contact support.”
3. **Revalidation or Manual Review**:

   * If confidence is borderline, an automated or human moderator can further inspect the quarantined text.
   * A moderation operator can either:

     * **Allow**: Approve content for re-processing with additional context or oversight.
     * **Deny**: Permanently reject it and potentially blacklist the user or IP for repeated hostile attempts.

## 4. Auditing Hooks

### 4.1. Logging & Alerting

* **Audit Log**: Every quarantine event is logged with a timestamp, user/session ID (if applicable), the flagged text (if permissible to store hashed/redacted), and the filter triggered.
* **Real-Time Alerts**: If the flagged text hits certain severity levels (e.g., repeated injection attempts, escalations), page a security or platform ops team.

### 4.2. Reporting & Metrics

* **Periodic Review**: Summaries of flagged attempts (volume, success rates, or trends) can inform future improvements to detection logic.
* **Machine Learning Iterations**: Incorporate these real-world examples to refine regex patterns, keyword lists, and semantic classifiers.

## 5. Example Workflow

1. **User Submits Prompt**:

   1. Regex Filter: Check for direct known malicious patterns. If matched, quarantine immediately.
   2. Semantic Filter: If not caught by regex, run the classifier to estimate “maliciousness” or “jailbreak-likelihood.”
2. **Filter Output**:

   * **Pass**: If the text is deemed clean, proceed with normal processing.
   * **Flag**: Text surpasses threshold → send to Quarantine Queue.
3. **Quarantine Queue**:

   * Returns a sanitized or generic error response to the user.
   * Moderation team or system logs the event and may review.
4. **Audit & Recycle**:

   * If the content is later deemed safe upon manual review, it can be re-injected in a controlled environment or white-listed for the future.
   * If confirmed malicious, the system can evolve (e.g., add new regex rules or classifier training data).

## 6. Summary of Key Protections

1. **Filtering**: Combination of regex pattern matching and semantic classification minimizes both known and novel jailbreak attempts.
2. **Quarantine**: Suspicious text never directly reaches end users.
3. **Auditing**: Extensive logs and real-time alerts help the security team spot new attack vectors and refine defenses.
4. **Zero Tolerance for Hostile Rewrites**: All malicious or flagged content stays isolated from normal user flow, preventing leaks of sensitive or system-level instructions.

With these layered guard-rails—regex/keyword scans, semantic analysis, quarantine queues, and auditing hooks—you can *drastically* reduce the risk of leaking jailbreak strings or internal system details, while providing a controlled process for managing any borderline or malicious content.
