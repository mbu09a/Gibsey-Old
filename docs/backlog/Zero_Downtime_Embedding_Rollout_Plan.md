Below is a high-level, step-by-step plan for **flag-gated rollout** of a new local (Ollama) embedding service alongside your existing cloud-based embedding service, with the goal of maintaining **zero downtime** and **no vector-ID drift**. The plan describes a **migration routine**, a **dual-write window**, and **rollback criteria** to ensure a smooth cutover.

## 1. Preparation & Setup

### 1.1. Environment Readiness

* **Provision Ollama**: Ensure your local Ollama environment for generating embeddings is fully set up, configured, and tested in a non-production environment (staging).
* **Version & Compatibility Checks**: Confirm you have the same text preprocessing and tokenization flows on both the cloud service and Ollama to avoid unexpected differences in embeddings.
* **Parallel Index or Schema**: If you store embeddings in a database or vector store, extend the schema (or provision a parallel index) to support storing both the existing cloud embeddings and new Ollama embeddings side by side.

### 1.2. Feature Flag Introduction

* **Feature Flag**: Create a feature flag (e.g., `useLocalEmbeddings`) that can be toggled at runtime.
* **Guarded Code Paths**: Make sure queries (reads) and writes to embeddings are wrapped in this feature flag logic.

---

## 2. Migration Routine

### 2.1. Dual-Write Implementation

1. **Dual-Write Logic**: Update the code that processes new or updated documents to generate:

   * **Cloud embeddings** (the existing approach).
   * **Local Ollama embeddings** (new approach).
2. **Shared or Parallel Storage**: Store both embeddings under a unified doc ID (or primary key).

   * Optionally, store them in separate fields: e.g. `embedding_cloud` and `embedding_ollama`.
   * Maintain the same "document ID" to prevent vector-ID drift. The only difference is the **embedding field**.

### 2.2. Backfill of Existing Data

* **Batch-Reprocess**: In a background job, systematically loop through existing documents and generate Ollama embeddings for each.
* **Validation**: After each batch, verify embeddings are stored correctly and no data integrity errors occur.
* **Progress Monitoring**: Use logs or counters to track how many of your total items have a corresponding Ollama embedding.

### 2.3. Observing Live Traffic (Still Reading from Cloud)

* While in dual-write, your system continues **reading** from the existing cloud-based embeddings but always **writes** both.
* **Performance & Quality Checks**:

  * Monitor the time taken to generate Ollama embeddings vs. cloud embeddings.
  * Validate random samples of Ollama embeddings for correctness and similarity distribution to cloud embeddings.

## 3. Dual-Write Window

This is the period where:

1. **Writes**: Write to both cloud and local embedding stores/fields.
2. **Reads**: Continue reading from cloud embeddings (the known-good path).
3. **Monitoring**: Collect performance metrics and validate functional correctness (precision/recall metrics in search tests, if applicable).

* **Duration**: A typical window can last from hours to weeks, depending on volume and risk tolerance.
* **Gate Criteria**: Define “exit criteria” for the dual-write window, such as:

  * 100% of documents have local embeddings generated.
  * No observed performance degradation or errors with Ollama.
  * Acceptance tests show search quality is within acceptable thresholds.

---

## 4. Rollout & Cutover

### 4.1. Partial Traffic Ramp (Read Shift)

1. **Staged Exposure**: Use your feature flag (`useLocalEmbeddings`) to control which percentage of traffic queries use Ollama embeddings:

   * Start with a small internal user group or a small percentage (5-10%).
   * Gradually increase to 50%, then 100% over time as metrics remain stable.
2. **Search Relevancy Validation**: Compare user satisfaction or search success rates between cloud-based and Ollama-based queries.

### 4.2. Full Flip to Local Embeddings

* Once you’re confident in the local embeddings, toggle `useLocalEmbeddings` to 100% for all traffic.
* The existing cloud embeddings remain in place (in parallel) for a defined safety period.

---

## 5. Rollback Criteria & Plan

### 5.1. Defining Failure Signals

Identify the metrics that would trigger a rollback:

* **Performance**: Generation or query times significantly exceed SLO/SLAs.
* **Quality/Relevancy**: Measurable drop in search precision, recall, or user satisfaction.
* **Stability**: Unexpected error spikes, timeouts, or memory issues in Ollama.

### 5.2. Immediate Rollback

* **Flag Toggle**: In an emergency or upon detection of unacceptable performance, instantly set `useLocalEmbeddings = false`.
* **Reads**: The system reverts to cloud embeddings for reads.
* **Writes**: Continue dual-writing or revert entirely to cloud-only, depending on severity and debugging needs.

### 5.3. Clean-up & Root-Cause Analysis

* If rollback happens:

  1. Collect logs and telemetry from Ollama to pinpoint the root issue.
  2. Plan for a fix or re-tune local embeddings.
  3. Re-enable partial traffic once the fix is validated in staging.

---

## 6. Decommissioning & Cleanup

Once Ollama embeddings are in full use and stable:

1. **Sunset the Cloud Embeddings**: Stop paying for or maintaining the older service (unless you want a fallback).
2. **Schema Pruning**: Remove the old `embedding_cloud` fields or indexes if they are no longer needed.
3. **Documentation**: Update ops runbooks and developer documentation to reflect the new embedding source.

# Summary of Key Points

1. **Feature Flag** (`useLocalEmbeddings`): Controls read path, toggles smoothly between cloud and local.
2. **Dual-Write Window**: Writes are done in parallel to both systems. Old indexing remains the primary read path while new embeddings are validated.
3. **Backfill**: All existing data is re-embedded by Ollama in background to ensure completeness.
4. **Cutover**: Gradually shift traffic to local embeddings.
5. **Rollback**: Monitor defined failure signals. A single flag toggle restores the system to the original embedding source in case of issues.

By following this structured approach, you can **hot-swap** from cloud to local embeddings without losing consistency or incurring downtime—and revert safely if anything goes wrong.
