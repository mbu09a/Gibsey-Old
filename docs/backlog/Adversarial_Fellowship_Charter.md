**The Adversarial Fellowship Charter**
*Drafted by Gibsey & Co. | Effective: \[Month/Year]*

---

## 1. Purpose & Principles

1. **Purpose**
   The Adversarial Fellowship is a monthly, organized red-team initiative dedicated to identifying and documenting potential vulnerabilities within Gibsey’s systems, processes, and products. It serves as an incubator for rigorous security testing, creative exploitation techniques, and subsequent resilience improvements.

2. **Core Principles**

   * **Integrity of Findings**: All adversarial testing efforts must be authentic, duplicable, and fully documented.
   * **Constructive Collaboration**: Red-teamers and internal engineering teams must work in partnership, aiming to strengthen systems rather than cause harm or disruption to production environments.
   * **Ethical Behavior**: Any discovered vulnerability is disclosed responsibly and privately within Gibsey’s agreed timelines and channels.
   * **Reward and Recognition**: Participants who discover significant vulnerabilities receive compensation in Magical Bonds—reinforcing the value of continual security contributions.

3. **Membership & Responsibilities**

   * **Fellows**: Skilled security researchers, penetration testers, and engineers working on short-term sprints.
   * **Arbiters**: Core maintainers who verify incoming findings, evaluate severity, and oversee the distribution of Magical Bonds.
   * **Observers**: Individuals (e.g., compliance officers, product owners) who have read access to the final Vault shard but do not actively contribute exploits or fixes.

## 2. Scope Tiers

In order to clarify which assets and systems are fair game for the monthly sprint, the Adversarial Fellowship defines **Scope Tiers**:

1. **Tier 1: Public Interfaces & APIs**

   * Includes websites, public endpoints, user-facing APIs, and marketing pages.
   * Typical vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), injection flaws, misconfigurations.
   * Focus: Stability and brand reputation.

2. **Tier 2: Production Services & Data Stores**

   * Covers core production environments, databases, microservices, and underlying application logic.
   * Typical vulnerabilities: Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, logic flaws.
   * Focus: Customer data protection and service continuity.

3. **Tier 3: Internal Tooling & Infrastructure**

   * Encompasses development pipelines, CI/CD services, corporate networks, and admin consoles.
   * Typical vulnerabilities: Lateral movement, spear-phishing, credential theft.
   * Focus: Protecting internal operations and pipeline integrity.

4. **Tier 4: Advanced or Experimental Systems**

   * New or unreleased products, sensitive R\&D efforts, specialized hardware, or any ephemeral infrastructure.
   * Typical vulnerabilities: Zero-day or previously unknown exploits targeting emerging architectures or experimental features.
   * Focus: Early detection, preventing exploit chains before public release.

Each monthly sprint may include specific sub-scope clarifications or expansions (e.g., specific microservices or limited Beta features within Tier 4).

## 3. Payout Logic (Using Magical Bonds)

Magical Bonds are a unique internal asset representing *guaranteed claim tickets* for future monetary compensation, professional accolades, or other intangible rewards. The Adversarial Fellowship uses the following logic to determine payouts:

1. **Severity Bands**

   * **Critical**: Direct compromise of production data, zero-day vulnerabilities with chainable exploits.
   * **High**: Privileged escalation, significant data exposure, or large-scale user impact.
   * **Medium**: Noticeable security gaps that require multiple conditions to be exploited.
   * **Low**: Minor or cosmetic vulnerabilities, less likely to lead to a material breach.

2. **Base Bounty Multipliers**

   * Each severity band has a *Base Bond Value* (e.g., `Critical = 1000 Magical Bonds`, `High = 500`, `Medium = 200`, `Low = 50`).
   * Final payouts can be adjusted for novelty, complexity, or thoroughness of exploitation steps.

3. **Validation & Bonus Factors**

   * **Novelty Bonus**: If the exploit reveals a previously unknown class of vulnerability in the environment, an additional +20% Bonds.
   * **Chain Bonus**: If a vulnerability can chain with other found exploits for broader impact, an additional +15% Bonds.
   * **Documentation Bonus**: Well-detailed proof of concept, reproducible steps, and recommended remediation can earn an additional +10% Bonds.

4. **Post-Sprint Conversion**

   * At the end of the sprint, Fellows can convert their Magical Bonds into credits, added to the Fellowship ledger.
   * Gibsey retains the flexibility to redeem Bonds in various ways (e.g., direct currency equivalence, philanthropic donations, or intangible perks like direct collaboration with leadership).

## 4. Disclosure Workflow

Responsible disclosure is paramount. The workflow ensures findings are delivered with minimal operational risk while maximizing collaboration:

1. **Initial Report**

   * Vulnerabilities are reported to the Arbiter team via a secure channel (e.g., an encrypted portal).
   * Provide necessary details: scope tier, severity estimate, POC video or screenshots, replication steps.

2. **Triage & Verification**

   * Arbiters confirm reproducibility and categorize severity using internal guidelines.
   * If reproducible, it’s added to the vulnerabilities backlog under an assigned priority level.

3. **Fix Development**

   * Relevant Gibsey product teams receive the vulnerability details on a secure, need-to-know basis.
   * Develop, test, and deploy mitigation or fixes in the staging environment before rolling out to production.

4. **Public/Private Disclosure Decision**

   * Internally, all vulnerabilities are documented in the Adversarial Fellowship Vault.
   * High- or Critical-severity findings may eventually warrant partial disclosure to external parties (e.g., if it impacts open-source libraries or partner systems). The timeline for external disclosure is decided case-by-case.

5. **Remediation Verification**

   * The red team (or an appointed third party) re-tests the fix in staging and production.
   * The verified fix is logged as “Resolved” or “Mitigated” in the Vault.

6. **Award & Settlement**

   * Arbiters calculate and distribute Magical Bonds to the reporting Fellow(s).
   * Fellows sign a short acceptance attestation confirming correct classification and reward.

## 5. Final Report to Canonical Vault Shard

Every sprint concludes with a **Final Report**, transforming from a dynamic security incident log into a *canonical Vault shard*—an immutable record of events and outcomes:

1. **Report Assembly**

   * The Final Report pulls consolidated data on discovered vulnerabilities, severity levels, assigned Magical Bonds, and resolution status.
   * Any supporting files (proof-of-concept code, screenshots, logs) are also compiled.

2. **Shard Creation**

   * The Arbiter team cryptographically signs the Final Report, generating a unique Shard ID.
   * This signature ensures authenticity—preventing unauthorized modifications.

3. **Vault Integration**

   * The new Shard is then committed to Gibsey’s central Vault.
   * The Vault maintains a tamper-evident ledger of all Shard IDs and their cryptographic hashes.

4. **Access & Governance**

   * Authorized personnel (Fellows, Arbiters, Observers) can query or review these Shards for compliance, audits, or historical context.
   * The Vault Shard stands as the **single source of truth** for all exploit data from that sprint—facilitating future security improvements and threat modeling.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Updates

* The Adversarial Fellowship Charter remains a living document, reviewed quarterly.
* Any changes to bounty multipliers, severity definitions, or the Magical Bonds framework must be approved by the Arbiter Council.
* Non-compliance or malicious abuse of discovered exploits may result in immediate expulsion from the program and potential legal action, depending on severity.

### Sign-Off

*By participating in Gibsey’s monthly red-team sprint, all Fellows, Arbiters, and Observers acknowledge the Charter and agree to abide by its rules and ethos.*
