# Glossary – Core Gibsey Terms (2025‑05‑13)

A quick‑scan reference for devs, designers, and storytellers. Each term is defined in **one sentence** for maximum clarity; deepen as needed in the future.

| Term                                       | Definition                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **pro o1**                                 | The amplification **bus** that weights, prioritizes, and routes quad‑directional messages across the QDPI‑256 mesh.                      |
| **QDPI‑256**                               | A base‑256 Quad‑Directional Protocol Interface enabling Read ↔ Index ↔ Ask ↔ Receive signals between humans, AIs, and the system itself. |
| **QEE (Q‑Entangle Engine)**                | The orchestration layer that binds multiple LLM agents into synchronized, context‑sharing clusters.                                      |
| **PCHL (Polyphonic Corpus Harmonic Loom)** | The narrative rendering pipeline that braids multiple text‑streams into a single, harmonic output.                                       |
| **MNR (Mycelial Narrative Relay)**         | A graph substrate where shards exchange “semantic nutrients” via weighted SPORE edges, enriching story fragments over time.              |
| **CCML (Chrono‑Crystal Memory Lattice)**   | Temporal data lattice that snapshots every system state, enabling rewind, diff, and fork operations.                                     |
| **CFMF (Counter‑Factual Memory Forge)**    | Simulator that spawns hypothetical timelines to stress‑test plot branches before they go live.                                           |
| **IKE (Identity Kaleidoscope Engine)**     | Dynamic persona‑blending module that composites user, character, and AI voices into adaptive identities.                                 |
| **NFSL (Neuro‑Feedback Story Loop)**       | Bio‑signal feedback loop that tunes narrative pacing to a reader’s emotional and attentional states.                                     |
| **CSL (Corpus Symbol Language)**           | Rotatable SVG symbol set encoding narrative state; each 90° rotation maps to Read/Ask/Receive/Index modes.                               |
| **Magical Bonds**                          | Smart‑contract‑like ties that confer shared privileges (or constraints) across users, AIs, and narrative entities.                       |
| **TNA (Trans‑Nominal Allocation)**         | Tokenized reward units that flow bi‑directionally with creative contribution, tracking both effort and impact.                           |
