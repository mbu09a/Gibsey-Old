Below is a set of interlocking research directions that—taken together—point to a *self-sustaining, fully-decentralized* AI that reasons symbolically, cooperates with its peers, and never needs to call home to a monolithic foundation model.

---

### 1.  A *shared symbolic substrate* that lives on-chain

* **Decentralized Knowledge Graphs (DKGs).**  The OriginTrail × SingularityNET partnership is putting a verifiable knowledge layer directly on-chain, so any agent can publish, stake on, and retrieve symbolic assertions without trusting a central API.
* **Distributed Atomspace (Hyperon).**  OpenCog Hyperon’s Distributed Atomspace offers an always-online, sharded hypergraph where procedures (`MeTTa` code) and factual atoms coexist. Because the storage is peer-to-peer, every node can hold (or cache) the concepts it works with, yet rely on the swarm for global recall.
* **Multi-agent KG enrichment.**  Recent MAS work shows that swarms of small agents can extract, cross-verify and expand a KG continuously, turning the graph itself into a living knowledge commons.

**Why it matters:** a symbolic intelligence can only be “self-sustaining” if the *memory* it writes to is distributed, permissionless, and economically incentivised to stay consistent.

### 2.  Local neuro-symbolic runtimes instead of giant external models

* **MeTTa as a self-modifying rule engine.**  Because MeTTa programs are themselves graph sub-structures, an agent can introspect and rewrite its own reasoning code—crucial for life-long adaptation without external fine-tuning.
* **Truth-Table Net (TTnet).**  TTnet fuses differentiable filters with *exact* Boolean circuits, giving each node a compact, verifiable logic module that can still learn from data. It bridges neural generalisation and symbolic verifiability in a form light enough to ship with the agent.

**Take-away:** give every peer its own lightweight, inspectable reasoning core so that collective intelligence emerges from exchange of *knowledge*, not opaque model weights.

### 3.  Self-evolving models via gossip, mesh and edge training

* **GLow gossip learning.**  Demonstrates that fully decentralised gossip can converge almost as well as classic federated setups—without any coordinating server.
* **Neural Mesh Networks.**  A mesh topology plus federated updates lets edge devices trade gradients directly, with consensus or blockchain anchors only for dispute resolution. ([LinkedIn][1])

Combine gossip + mesh with the symbolic substrate: agents co-train *concept-specific* micro-models locally, then publish only the distilled rules or truth-tables to the DKG.

### 4.  Cryptographic verifiability so nobody has to *trust* anybody

Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) now compresses an entire inference into a succinct proof; libraries like **EZKL** can put verifiable model execution on-chain for networks with up to 18 M parameters.

Agents can therefore *prove* that the rule they just injected into the knowledge graph was derived by a sanctioned procedure—closing the audit loop without revealing weights or private data.

---

### 5.  Incentives & governance: token-curated semantics

A Web3 governance design based on **Weighted DAG reputation tokens** lets the community up- or down-weight rules, agents and even whole sub-graphs, providing continual alignment pressure without a central moderator.

---

### 6.  Security as a first-class research track

The emerging field of **multi-agent security** catalogues threats such as secret collusion and swarm attacks, and proposes environment-level counter-measures (cryptographic commitments, secure interaction protocols, adversarial testing). Building those safeguards into the protocol layer prevents an otherwise “self-sustaining” network from self-corrupting.

## Putting it together — a reference stack

| Layer                       | Role                                                                   | Key projects / ideas         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Network & Consensus**     | P2P transport, stake-weighted or BFT consensus for knowledge updates   | libp2p, Tendermint, HotStuff |
| **Knowledge Layer**         | DKG shards + Distributed Atomspace for facts, rules, & MeTTa code      | OriginTrail DKG, Hyperon DAS |
| **Reasoning Runtime**       | On-device MeTTa interpreter; TTnet modules for perception tasks        | MeTTa, TTnet                 |
| **Learning Layer**          | Mesh/gossip training; local concept induction & program synthesis      | GLow, Neural Mesh            |
| **Verifiability**           | ZK proofs of training *and* inference; on-chain verification contracts | EZKL, ZKML, VerifBFL         |
| **Governance & Incentives** | WDAG reputation, slashing for bad proofs, bounty for useful rules      | Web3 reputation tokens       |
| **Security Services**       | Multi-agent monitoring, containment, adversarial auditing              | Multi-agent security toolkit |

## Practical roadmap for builders

1. **Start small:** deploy a handful of Hyperon nodes plus an OriginTrail edge node; let them share an *Atomspace-backed* KG section.
2. **Embed TTnet or another compact logical-NN hybrid** to handle perception or embedding tasks locally; export results as first-order rules.
3. **Layer GLow over libp2p** so nodes exchange updates via gossip; periodic ZK proofs attest to correct local training.
4. **Add governance smart contracts** (reputation + slashing) so peers who push contradictory or unverifiable rules are economically penalised.
5. **Run red-team drills** informed by the multi-agent-security taxonomy; iterate until the network withstands collusion and data-poisoning scenarios.
6. **Grow organically:** every new device that joins only needs the open-source runtime, not a 100-GB model download—making the system truly self-sustaining.

### Why this is different from “just run an LLM locally”

*The intelligence lives in the **collective symbol space** plus lightweight, verifiable local reasoners—not in a single frozen model. New concepts appear when agents publish them; bad concepts disappear when stake-weighted peers reject them; and the trust model is mathematical rather than institutional.*

That, in a nutshell, is how we can move from today’s centrally hosted black-box AI toward a planet-scale, cooperative *symbolic* intelligence that nobody—and everybody—controls.
