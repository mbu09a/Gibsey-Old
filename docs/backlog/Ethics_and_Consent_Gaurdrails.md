# Ethics & Consent Guard‑Rails (Draft v0.1)

*A living document—update as systems mature. Bold ★ bullets indicate sections requiring deeper policy work.*

---

## 1 · Purpose

Establish baseline principles and operational safeguards that protect users, creators, and AI agents within the Gibsey ecosystem from harm, exploitation, or unwanted surveillance.

## 2 · Core Principles  (borrowed & adapted from the prior MPC consent framework)

* **Explicit Informed Consent** — no data capture, narrative logging, or biometric sensing without clear, revocable user opt‑in.
* **User Autonomy** — users can freeze, rewind, or fork their data (〈CCML〉) at any time; system must surface an “Abort & Scrub” control within two clicks.
* **Proportional Data Minimization** — collect only what each service tier strictly requires; purge volatile traces after diffusion is complete.
* **Reciprocal Transparency** — every automated decision (e.g., pro o1 priority score) is explainable on demand via `/explain/:message_id`.
* **Shared Stewardship** — Magical Bonds extend rights *and* responsibilities across linked parties; breaking a bond triggers a review flow.

## 3 · Consent Workflow

| Step                   | Actor   | Modal Copy                                           | Data Affected                           |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Request**         | Service | “May we store this shard interaction in your Vault?” | Shard ID, timestamp, nutrient scores    |
| 2. **Granular Toggle** | User    | Checkbox matrix: `text`, `embeddings`, `biosignals`  | Selected rows only                      |
| 3. **Confirm & Sign**  | User    | “I agree (Magical Bond #412C)”                       | Stores consent token                    |
| 4. **Revoke**          | User    | ‘Revoke’ link in Vault timeline                      | Immediate hard delete + event broadcast |

★ **Deeper Policy Needed**: Biometric data (NFSL) & minors’ consent.

## 4 · Data Privacy & Security

* All shards & Vault entries encrypted at rest (AES‑256).
* End‑to‑end TLS 1.3 for Web + WebSocket traffic.
* Role‑based access control keyed to **TNA stake**.
* Quarterly penetration testing + public report.

★ **Deeper Policy Needed**: GDPR/CCPA harmonization, right‑to‑be‑forgotten pipeline.

## 5 · Content Moderation & Safe‑Completion

* **Tier 1**: Real‑time filter for disallowed content (CSAM, extremist calls to violence) before persistence.
* **Tier 2**: GPT‑4o streaming monitor flags potential self‑harm; offers hotline resources *optionally*—never forcefully.
* **Tier 3**: Community review panel (rotating 3 human mods) arbitrate edge cases; final decision posted to transparency log.

★ **Deeper Policy Needed**: Appeals process & restorative‑justice model.

## 6 · Accessibility & Inclusivity

* WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for all UI.
* Alt‑text auto‑generation on every Corpus Symbol render.
* Opt‑in dyslexia‑friendly font toggle.
* Support screen‑reader‑friendly SVG symbol descriptions.

## 7 · Open Questions / Next Sprint Targets

1. Define default retention window for raw NFSL biosignals.
2. Formalize Magical Bond breach procedure (who adjudicates?).
3. Design incentive model (via TNA) for community moderators.
4. Map GDPR Article 17 compliance onto CCML rewind/delete primitives.
