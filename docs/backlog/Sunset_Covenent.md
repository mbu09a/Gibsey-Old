Below is a concise procedure defining how the “kill-switch” (or “Sunset Covenant”) is ethically executed if Gibsey needs to wind down. It covers who may invoke it, how shards are archived, how ledger balances settle, and how users export personal memories.

---

## 1. Invocation

1. **Council of Custodians**: A designated council (minimum of three recognized stewards, elected or appointed by the community) must unanimously vote to authorize the kill-switch.
2. **Emergency Clause**: If the council is unreachable or compromised, an emergency sponsor (trusted legal or ethical body named in Gibsey’s governance charter) can invoke the procedure with transparent public notice.
3. **Public Declaration**: Once invoked, the kill-switch announcement is published on all official channels, providing a clear timeline and steps for users.

## 2. Archiving Shards

1. **Snapshot and Seal**: Each operational shard (e.g., Vault, ledger, data store) is snapshotted at the final block height or timestamp. Snapshots are cryptographically sealed with multi-signature keys held by the council.
2. **Off-Site Redundancy**: The sealed snapshots are uploaded to at least two neutral archives (e.g., reputable data-archiving organizations or public distributed storage) to prevent tampering or accidental loss.
3. **Open Hash Registry**: The hashes of the final snapshots are published in a registry accessible to anyone, ensuring verifiability of the archived shards.

## 3. Ledger Balances Settlement

1. **Final Ledger State**: All ledger accounts are locked at the moment of kill-switch invocation. No further transactions are processed afterward.
2. **Withdrawal Window**: Users have a specified grace period (e.g., 30 days) to withdraw or transfer digital assets under a read-only mode.
3. **Residual Holdings**: Any unclaimed balances at the end of the withdrawal window are pooled into a publicly identified “Sunset Fund.”
4. **Sunset Distribution**: The Sunset Fund is disbursed according to a pre-approved formula—often proportionally returned to known stakeholders or donated to a neutral public interest group if no rightful claimant is found.

## 4. User Memory Export

1. **Data Packaging**: Each user can download their personal data (“memories”) in an open-standard format (e.g., JSON or CSV for text-based data, plus appropriate media bundles for images/audio).
2. **Self-Service Portal**: The platform provides a final export interface for a limited time, allowing users to retrieve all content associated with their identity.
3. **Privacy Assurance**: Exports exclude any data marked private by other users, respecting prior privacy constraints.
4. **Offline Access**: After the final day, the data exports remain available from the public archives, using the sealed snapshot and user-specific encryption keys (where applicable).

## 5. Ethical Safeguards

1. **Transparency**: All steps, from invocation to final archiving, must be logged and openly reported.
2. **Community Oversight**: The council’s decisions (and any emergency sponsor actions) must be verifiable through the final snapshot.
3. **No Dark Deletions**: The kill-switch does not secretly erase records; rather, it transitions them into read-only archival form with minimal community disruption.

This Sunset Covenant ensures an orderly, transparent close of Gibsey’s operations, preserving user data, fairly settling accounts, and upholding ethical stewardship.
