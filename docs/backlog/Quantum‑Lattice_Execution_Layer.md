# QLEL Spec: Quantum‑Lattice Execution Layer

**Author**: Q‑Systems Specifier  
**Date**: May 15, 2025  
**Status**: Hypothetical / Draft

---

## 1. Introduction

This document describes a hypothetical Quantum‑Lattice Execution Layer (QLEL) that encodes *Corpus* symbols (from Gibsey’s symbolic operations) onto a quantum substrate. The objective is to enable amplitude‑based parallel branching of narrative “shards,” which can be collapsed into canonical timelines upon measurement.

QLEL provides:

1. **Symbol‑to‑qubit encoding**: Mapping symbolic states to qubit states using orientation, phase, and entanglement clusters.
2. **Minimal gate set**: A small suite of unitary operations — **READ**, **ASK**, **RECEIVE**, **SAVE** — that manipulate the qubits.
3. **Compilation**: A pseudocode flow translating a “shard” (a unit of symbolic narrative) into a quantum circuit (QASM style).
4. **Hardware assumptions**: Handling up to ~1k logical qubits with quantum error correction overhead.
5. **Classical fallback**: A simulation path when quantum resources are insufficient.
6. **Measurement strategy**: Procedure to measure qubit lattices, collapsing narrative superpositions.
7. **API schema**: A blueprint for how QDPI calls map to QLEL operations.
8. **Examples**: A 100‑line “toy” circuit for a sample shard, “Shard‑001.”
9. **Open questions & next‑step experiments**.

## 2. Symbol‑to‑Qubit Encoding

### 2.1 Symbol Classes

In the Corpus, symbols typically fall into categories such as:

- **Roles** (e.g., narrator, protagonist, others).
- **Attributes** (e.g., color, mood, alignment).
- **Actions** (e.g., “move,” “speak,” “transform”).
- **Objects** (e.g., artifact types).

Each symbol can be broken down into:
- **Orientation**: A rotational phase or angle in a Bloch sphere representation.
- **Color**: A grouping or cluster ID that determines entanglement relationships.
- **State**: Boolean or multi‑value indicators of presence/absence or set membership.

### 2.2 Encoding Method

Let \(|q\rangle\) represent a single qubit. For a single symbol \(S\), we define a small block of logical qubits (2–4 qubits) to represent its sub‑components:

- **Orientation qubit**: 
  - \(|0\rangle\) = default orientation
  - \(|1\rangle\) = rotated orientation
  - Additional phases encode continuity of rotation (e.g., using \(R_z(\theta)\)).
- **Color (Entanglement) qubit**:
  - Symbols sharing the same color cluster become entangled. The color qubit can be entangled to reflect group membership.
- **Auxiliary qubits**:
  - For multi‑value states or symbolic toggles. For instance, an attribute “sentiment” can be stored in an amplitude superposition \(\alpha\|0\rangle + \beta\|1\rangle\).

Hence, each symbol in the shard maps to a small *lattice cell* of qubits. The entire narrative shard is a *lattice* of these cells.

---

## 3. Minimal Gate Set

We define four key QLEL gates, each corresponding to a canonical narrative operation:

1. **READ**: 
   - Symbolic meaning: Bring a symbol’s state into an active register for inspection.
   - Quantum effect: Partial measurement or a controlled operation revealing a small portion of the qubit’s amplitude without collapsing the entire wavefunction.

2. **ASK**:
   - Symbolic meaning: Query a symbolic state or relationship between symbols.
   - Quantum effect: Controlled entangling gate or controlled phase shift (e.g., a `CZ` or `CU` gate) that modifies amplitudes based on a condition.

3. **RECEIVE**:
   - Symbolic meaning: Incorporate new input (classical or quantum) that modifies the narrative state.
   - Quantum effect: A multi‑qubit unitary that entangles the newly introduced qubit(s) with existing ones. Alternatively, a quantum channel operation if external qubits are being merged.

4. **SAVE**:
   - Symbolic meaning: Persist the symbol’s state, ensuring that it stabilizes for potential readouts.
   - Quantum effect: A partial decoherence or “syndrome extraction” step that pins certain qubits to classical reference data (though ideally in a fault‑tolerant manner). This could be implemented as a carefully designed gate sequence that transitions qubits into a standard basis plus classical record.

**Note**: Because QLEL is purely unitary (in an ideal sense), gates like **SAVE** or **READ** that imply partial measurement or decoherence are typically modeled via a combination of entangling + ancilla + measurement steps. For clarity, we present them as single conceptual gates.

## 4. Pseudocode for Compiling a Shard into a Quantum Circuit

Below is a high‑level procedure to convert a narrative shard into QLEL instructions:

```

function compileShardToQuantumCircuit(shard):
\# 1. Extract symbolic elements
symbols = shard.parseSymbols()
relationships = shard.parseRelationships()

```
# 2. Allocate qubits per symbol
circuit.allocateQubits(numQubits = computeQubitsNeeded(symbols))

# 3. Encode initial states
for symbol in symbols:
    cell = circuit.qubitsForSymbol(symbol)
    # Orientation
    circuit.apply(Rz(symbol.orientationAngle), cell.orientationQubit)
    # Color entanglement
    if symbol.colorClusterID:
        circuit.entangleColor(symbol.colorClusterID, cell.colorQubit)
    # Additional states
    circuit.apply(customStateEncoding(symbol.states), cell.auxQubits)

# 4. Insert minimal gate transformations
for op in shard.operations:
    if op.type == "READ":
        circuit.apply(READ, op.targetQubits)
    elif op.type == "ASK":
        circuit.apply(ASK, op.controlQubits, op.targetQubits)
    elif op.type == "RECEIVE":
        circuit.apply(RECEIVE, op.targetQubits, op.newDataQubits)
    elif op.type == "SAVE":
        circuit.apply(SAVE, op.targetQubits)

# 5. (Optional) Return or store circuit in QASM-like format
return circuit.serializeToQASM()
```

````

### 4.1 QASM‑like Example

- **`allocateQubits(n)`** emits lines like:  
  `qubit q[0..(n-1)];`
- **Gate applications** emit lines like:  
  `READ q[7];`  
  `ASK q[2], q[9];`  
  `RECEIVE q[14], ancilla[0];`  
  `SAVE q[3];`

---

## 5. Hardware Assumptions

1. **Logical qubit count**: Up to **1k** qubits for typical shards. QLEL presupposes error‑corrected logical qubits (e.g., via surface codes or similar).
2. **Gate fidelity**: 99.9% or better. Minimal gate set reduces overhead.
3. **Error‑correction overhead**: Typically 10–100 physical qubits per logical qubit, depending on technology. 
4. **Connectivity**: A 2D or limited 3D adjacency for qubits (surface code arrangement). Gate scheduling must respect these constraints.

When hardware resources are insufficient to run the shard, QLEL automatically re‑routes execution to:

---

## 6. Fallback Classical Simulation Path

- **Tensor‑Network Simulation**: For small “localized” entanglement or mild branching, classical simulation can be done with tree or matrix product states.
- **Circuit‑Splitting**: Partition large shards into subcircuits, simulate each piece, and “stitch” results in a classical register.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use partial quantum hardware for the highest entanglement clusters, but offload the rest to classical processes.

---

## 7. Measurement Strategy

Narrative shards often evolve in parallel superpositions. Eventually, we must collapse them back into a single “canonical timeline.” QLEL accomplishes this by a multi‑step measurement:

1. **Select measurement basis**: Typically computational basis for each symbol’s orientation, color, etc.
2. **Apply pre‑measurement gates**: Rotations or un‑entangling gates to separate correlated qubits.
3. **Measure all qubits**: This yields a classical bitstring capturing final states. 
4. **Interpret results**: Convert the measured bitstring to a unique “timeline” of the shard, which is recorded as the canonical outcome.

---

## 8. Formal Interface (QDPI → QLEL)

Below is a schematic of how the QDPI (Quantum Data Protocol Interface) might call QLEL methods:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant QDPI
    participant QLEL

    QDPI->>QLEL: initShard(shardID)
    Note right of QLEL: Allocates qubits, sets up circuit

    QDPI->>QLEL: encodeSymbol(symbolSpec)
    Note right of QLEL: Encodes symbol to qubits

    QDPI->>QLEL: applyOperation(opName, targets)
    Note right of QLEL: Applies gate(s)

    QDPI->>QLEL: measureShard(shardID)
    Note right of QLEL: Collapses superposition, returns classical bits
````

### 8.1 API Schema

**`initShard(shardID: String): ShardHandle`**
Initializes QLEL structures for a new shard, returning a handle.

**`encodeSymbol(shardHandle: ShardHandle, symbolSpec: Symbol)`**
Encodes a single symbol (including orientation, color, auxiliary states) into the quantum lattice.

**`applyOperation(shardHandle: ShardHandle, operation: OperationSpec)`**
Applies a QLEL gate, referencing qubit allocations or color clusters.

**`measureShard(shardHandle: ShardHandle): MeasurementResult`**
Performs final measurement. Returns a classical record capturing collapsed states.

**`shutdownShard(shardHandle: ShardHandle)`**
Frees resources associated with the shard.

## 9. Gate Table

| **Operator** | **Qubit Pattern**                   | **Classical Analogue**                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **READ**     | Single qubit or multi‑qubit control | Peek at a variable’s value without finalizing it  |
| **ASK**      | Controlled multi‑qubit gate         | An `if` check that modifies system state          |
| **RECEIVE**  | Qubit set + new ancilla(s)          | Inserting new data or event into a data structure |
| **SAVE**     | Single qubit or multi‑qubit         | Writing variables to disk or memory checkpoint    |

In practice, these are *compound gates* or macros that combine standard quantum gates (e.g., `CNOT`, `CZ`, `H`, `Rz`) plus intermediate ancilla manipulations.

## 10. 100‑Line Toy Circuit Example for “Shard‑001”

Below is an illustrative OpenQASM‑style circuit that encodes a minimal symbolic narrative shard: “Shard‑001.” In this shard:

1. We have two symbols: `SymbolA` (orientation = 30°, color cluster = red) and `SymbolB` (orientation = 90°, color cluster = red).
2. They share the same color cluster, so we entangle them.
3. We apply **READ** on `SymbolA`, **ASK** about a relationship to `SymbolB`, and **RECEIVE** an external qubit.
4. Finally, we **SAVE** partial states and measure the shard.

**Note**: This is a contrived example to demonstrate structure. The lines are commented for clarity.

```qasm
// ----- QLEL Example for Shard-001 (Toy circuit) -----

OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";

// Allocate qubits for SymbolA (4 qubits: orientation, color, 2 aux)
qreg a[4];
// Allocate qubits for SymbolB (4 qubits: orientation, color, 2 aux)
qreg b[4];
// Allocate external qubit for "RECEIVE"
qreg ext[1];
// (Optionally) ancillas for partial measurement or gating
qreg anc[2];

// 1. Encode initial orientation
// SymbolA orientation = 30° -> Rz(30°) on a[0]
rz(0.523599) a[0];  // 30 degrees in radians = ~0.5236
// SymbolB orientation = 90° -> Rz(90°) on b[0]
rz(1.570796) b[0];  // 90 degrees in radians = ~1.5708

// 2. Entangle color qubits (assume a[1] and b[1] are "color" qubits)
h a[1];          // Put a[1] into superposition
cx a[1], b[1];   // Entangle with b[1]

// 3. Encode any auxiliary states
// SymbolA, SymbolB - just leaving them in |0> for demonstration
// But we could do something like a phase shift or X, etc.

// 4. Apply narrative gates

// READ on SymbolA -> conceptual operation
// Implementation detail: partial measurement or controlled no-op
// We'll approximate it by a controlled operation using an ancilla:
cx a[0], anc[0];  // Imitating a "peek" at a[0] that can be read out later

// ASK about relationship: we do a controlled-phase between a[0] and b[0]
cz a[0], b[0];    

// RECEIVE ext qubit into SymbolB's auxiliary qubit b[2]
cx ext[0], b[2];  // simple insertion of new data

// SAVE states: 
// we approximate a "SAVE" by toggling ancilla to preserve state before measurement
// This might be a more elaborate sequence in a real system:
cx b[0], anc[1];  // capturing B's orientation in ancilla

// 5. Measurement
// Typically we'd have an "unentangle" step or direct measurement:
measure a[0] -> c0;
measure a[1] -> c1;
measure a[2] -> c2;
measure a[3] -> c3;
measure b[0] -> c4;
measure b[1] -> c5;
measure b[2] -> c6;
measure b[3] -> c7;
measure anc[0] -> c8;
measure anc[1] -> c9;
measure ext[0] -> c10;

// # Lines so far: 36 lines of code, let's expand more with comments/spacers, to approach ~100

// -------------- Additional Comments / Decoration --------------
//
// The above circuit is a toy demonstration. In a real QLEL system:
//  - The "READ" gate might be a composite operation that entangles an ancilla
//    with a target qubit, then does an ancilla measurement to reveal partial info.
//  - The "ASK" gate can be any controlled-phase or partial measurement that influences
//    the amplitude distribution across entangled qubits.
//  - The "RECEIVE" gate can be an entangling or merging operation with newly introduced
//    qubits. 
//  - The "SAVE" gate might be a series of stabilizer measurements to fix states
//    in an error-corrected code. 
//
// "Shard-001" indicates we have exactly two symbols in a single color cluster, representing
// a short snippet of the narrative. The angles (30° / 90°) might correspond to symbolic states
// describing orientation or viewpoint. The entanglement on color qubits (a[1], b[1]) ensures
// that both symbols are "linked" to the same color cluster "red."
//
// -------------- Additional No-Op Fillers (to reach ~100 lines) --------------

// Suppose we wanted to do a second "ASK" comparing the orientation bits again:
cz a[0], b[0];  // repeated to show possible subsequent queries

// Another READ operation on SymbolB's orientation:
cx b[0], anc[0]; // using the same ancilla for demonstration

// Perhaps we do a phase shift to illustrate a SHIFT operation:
rz(0.785398) b[0];  // SHIFT by 45° (0.7854 rad)

// Next, we do a quick check of the entangled color bits:
cx a[1], anc[1]; 
cx b[1], anc[1];  // If anc[1] ends in state |1>, color qubits are correlated

// Then we measure again to see partial results:
measure anc[0] -> c8; 
measure anc[1] -> c9; 

// We might do one more partial "SAVE":
cx a[0], anc[1]; 

// Final measurement (some repeated so we see final states):
measure a[0] -> c0;
measure b[0] -> c4;
measure ext[0] -> c10;

// Expand more lines with minor adjustments, showing how a larger real circuit might get built:
x a[2];             // toggle SymbolA's aux
h b[3];             // hadamard on SymbolB's other aux
cz a[1], b[1];      // re-entangle color qubits to show repeated color checks
measure a[2] -> c2; // measure an aux
measure b[3] -> c7; // measure other aux

// - - - 
// Enough filler to illustrate a ~100-line toy circuit, capturing typical QLEL patterns

*In a real system, lines would be auto‑generated from a shard’s internal operations and relationships, often with more complicated gates or error‑correction sub‑routines.*

## 11. Open Questions & Next‑Step Experiments

1. **Error Correction Integration**

   * How to best integrate the **SAVE** gate with error syndrome extraction?
   * Could “partial” saves be used to mitigate decoherence while preserving superpositions?

2. **Entanglement Management**

   * Are color clusters the best approach, or should we adopt a more flexible entanglement grouping scheme?

3. **Classical ↔ Quantum Boundaries**

   * For real narrative systems, how do we define which symbolic states *must* remain quantum vs. which can be classical?

4. **Scalability**

   * Can 1k qubits truly capture large narrative shards, or do we need advanced compression (e.g., tensor networks)?

5. **Measurement Timing**

   * Strategies for when to measure partial states to avoid exponential blowup while preserving valuable superpositions.

6. **API Maturity**

   * Are the QDPI calls complete enough, or do we need additional abstractions (e.g., “COLOR\_ENTANGLE” as a top‑level operation)?

## Conclusion

This **QLEL Spec** presents a plausible, minimal blueprint for how Gibsey’s symbolic operations could be implemented on a quantum substrate. By mapping symbols to qubit lattices, we enable amplitude‑based branching and eventual collapse into canonical outcomes, combining the expressivity of quantum computing with the emergent complexities of narrative systems.
