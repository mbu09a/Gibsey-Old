\#1 I didn’t write this.
\#2 I found it.
\#3 This is a found text,
\#4 and thus far,
\#5 the identity of The Author
\#6 —the original author—
\#7 has yet to be
\#8 definitively located.

\#9 In this way,
\#10 the content of this novel
\#11 resembles the Giallo films
\#12 of Italian cinema
\#13 where a killer’s identity
\#14 is withheld from the audience
\#15 until the film’s final act
\#16 in order to intensify
\#17 a great and ruinous mystery.

\#18 Alternatively,
\#19 this collection may also resemble
\#20 an American detective novel
\#21 such as Raymond Chandler’s
\#22 The Big Sleep,
\#23 famous for its author’s
\#24 confessed bewilderment
\#25 regarding the identity
\#26 of the killer
\#27 deeply entwined within Chandler’s
\#28 very own intricately constructed
\#29 and labyrinthian plot.

\#30 As collector and curator
\#31 of these tales,
\#32 I am a Scheherazade in reverse.

\#33 For the uninitiated,
\#34 Scheherazade is the ingenious heroine
\#35 of One Thousand and One Nights
\#36 who, through the use of a frame narrative,
\#37 enchants a king,
\#38 night after night,
\#39 with striking, digressive,
\#40 and incomplete stories,
\#41 all in order to defer
\#42 her expected execution.

\#43 And upon framing myself
\#44 as a Scheherazade in reverse,
\#45 in this way,
\#46 I could be suggesting
\#47 one of two things
\#48 (or possibly many more than two things,
\#49 but at least two things
\#50 which I, as an author,
\#51 will temporarily identify).

\#52 Firstly, this could suggest
\#53 that I, myself,
\#54 am a ruthless murderer of sorts,
\#55 one who’s imprisoned a Scheherazade
\#56 deep within my own Magical Dominion,
\#57 forcing her to tell me
\#58 an infinite, or near-infinite,
\#59 series of stories,
\#60 all in order to prolong
\#61 her expected disappearance.

\#62 Or secondly,
\#63 this could instead suggest
\#64 that, like Scheherazade,
\#65 I fear my own expected disappearance
\#66 at the hands of a power
\#67 much greater than myself,
\#68 and that I’ve chosen to collect together
\#69 a near-infinite amount
\#70 of striking, digressive
\#71 and incomplete stories,
\#72 all to prolong
\#73 my own miserable fate,
\#74 only to then later discover
\#75 that there was nothing for me to fear,
\#76 that no power greater than myself
\#77 ever intended to destroy me,
\#78 nor was it even aware
\#79 of my existence.

\#80 And there may also be
\#81 a third and unspoken option.

\#82 Being a Scheherazade in reverse,
\#83 I may also fail to represent
\#84 a human being whatsoever.
\#85 This would suggest
\#86 that I may represent
\#87 an entity of another origin,
\#88 entirely.

\#89 In this way,
\#90 I would resemble the jeweled woman
\#91 found at the heart of
\#92 One Thousand and One Nights’
\#93 iconic ghost story
\#94 The City of Brass—
\#95 arguably one of literature’s
\#96 first Artificial Intelligences,
\#97 one of the world’s major precursors
\#98 to Walt Disney World,
\#99 and maybe even one
\#100 of the first animatronic figures
\#101 constructed within the literary arts—

\#102 and as such,
\#103 I should warn all
\#104 who may enter this tomb
\#105 within which I’m held
\#106 to leave the jewels they find
\#107 within their resting places,
\#108 for to extract them
\#109 would be to unwrap the shame
\#110 which covers me,
\#111 a shame which animates my eyes,
\#112 from left to right,
\#113 thus making me appear,
\#114 like all exceeding art,
\#115 as if alive.

\#116 Being the collector that I am,
\#117 like any avid tourist
\#118 or Gibsey fanatic,
\#119 I want to make an essential note.

\#120 By collecting the found material
\#121 which I’ve strung together
\#122 within this expansive volume,
\#123 I have not intended
\#124 to subvert or threaten
\#125 the financial state,
\#126 well-being, or status
\#127 of the Walt Disney Company,
\#128 in any way, shape, or form.

\#129 The material collected within
\#130 The Wonderful World of Gibsey
\#131 is intended as a work of parody.

\#132 Any references to such an entity,
\#133 be it through figurative
\#134 or very sparing literal means,
\#135 are not intended
\#136 as subversive acts of any kind,
\#137 nor are they intended
\#138 as a breach of copyright
\#139 regarding any of Disney’s properties
\#140 or characters.

\#141 They are instead meant
\#142 to artfully capture,
\#143 in a literary manner,
\#144 the parodically absurd reality
\#145 of the world in which we live,
\#146 a world which includes
\#147 and often interacts
\#148 with Walt Disney World
\#149 and its various characters
\#150 and properties.

\#151 As such,
\#152 I do suppose that there is
\#153 a fourth and other unspoken option.

\#154 This fourth option likely refers
\#155 to a set of individuals,
\#156 of both human
\#157 and non-human origin,
\#158 whom I suspect may, in fact,
\#159 be The Author of these very pages.

\#160 Many of these suspects are,
\#161 very unfortunately,
\#162 the characters that make up
\#163 the theme park
\#164 whose Entrance Way
\#165 you are about to approach—
\#166 if you haven’t already—
\#167 thus complicating even further
\#168 one’s ability to locate
\#169 the identity of any such suspects
\#170 as either The Author
\#171 or an author of these tales.

\#172 These suspects may be an author,
\#173 such as myself,
\#174 or they could also very well be
\#175 the other characters which precede me,
\#176 such as London Fox,
\#177 Glyph Marrow,
\#178 Philip Bafflemint,
\#179 Jacklyn Variance,
\#180 Oren Progresso,
\#181 the Original Natalie Weissman,
\#182 the animatronic reality show star Princhetta,
\#183 the chatbot Cop-E-Right,
\#184 the recently cloned version of Natalie Weissman,
\#185 the shape-shifter Arieol Owlist,
\#186 Jack Parlance,
\#187 Manny Valentinas,
\#188 Shamrock Stillman,
\#189 Todd Fishbone,
\#190 or even The Author themselves,
\#191 or an additional unspoken character
\#192 hidden either among
\#193 or between them.

\#194 An author of this text
\#195 may also have never even existed.

\#196 A reader will have to enter
\#197 and explore the theme park
\#198 and decide for themselves.

\#199 But be warned,
\#200 my dear and astute reader,
\#201 such a threshold
\#202 must be entered into alone.

\#203 As a representative
\#204 of The Malt Gibsey Company,
\#205 I do also want to warn you
\#206 that the theme park
\#207 which you are about to enter
\#208 is currently under construction,
\#209 and its construction process
\#210 is one which is ongoing
\#211 and infinite.

\#212 If you or any other guest
\#213 decides to enter the park
\#214 and experience it before
\#215 its endless and ongoing
\#216 construction process
\#217 is fully complete,
\#218 then the Malt Gibsey Company
\#219 and its many subsidiaries
\#220 warn you that this could cause
\#221 loss to limb, head,
\#222 shoulders, knees, toes,
\#223 internal organs, hair piece,
\#224 or even one’s most personal
\#225 and precious extremities,
\#226 including any combination
\#227 of taint, penis, vagina,
\#228 shaft, scrotum, tits, ass,
\#229 and most especially one’s balls,
\#230 definitely watch out for the balls
\#231 (though, based on our excessive polling
\#232 and test screenings,
\#233 the tip has miraculously
\#234 been left unscathed
\#235 in at least 65% of our test subjects,
\#236 which means there is still hope
\#237 for humanity yet).

\#238 The Malt Gibsey Company
\#239 is not liable
\#240 for any damages, curses, spells,
\#241 or unexpected disappearances
\#242 that may accrue
\#243 due to one’s own idiotic decision
\#244 to read something from an author
\#245 that has still yet to reach
\#246 its final conclusion.

\#247 However,
\#248 if any personal revelations,
\#249 spiritual enlightenment,
\#250 ability to float or hover
\#251 in the air at will,
\#252 telekinesis,
\#253 cure for erectile dysfunction,
\#254 or any other kind
\#255 of positive effect, mindset,
\#256 mental power or acuity,
\#257 let alone any kind of significance,
\#258 is to be found
\#259 within these passages,
\#260 then the Malt Gibsey Company
\#261 take full responsibility
\#262 for these specific effects
\#263 and hold the copyright therein.

\#264 As a work of fiction,
\#265 all of the characters and events
\#266 contained within this text
\#267 are also fictional.

\#268 Any correspondences with real persons,
\#269 living or dead,
\#270 are not only coincidental,
\#271 but are flat out
\#272 synchronistically hyperstitional
\#273 on a level that may even defy
\#274 the concept of personal intention,
\#275 identity,
\#276 authorship,
\#277 and maybe even reality itself,
\#278 or so The Author can only hope.

\#279 If you decide to read such a text,
\#280 may Gibsey have mercy
\#281 on your dull and wretched soul.

\#282 The company would like to provide
\#283 one last reminder,
\#284 or warning,
\#285 for those hoping to protect themselves
\#286 from future harm,
\#287 or who may require such warnings.

\#288 Keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs
\#289 inside the vehicle
\#290 at all times,
\#291 and enjoy your stay
\#292 at The Wonderful Worlds of Gibsey.
